# Initial Concept
The project is an automated article-to-speech generator designed for news articles. It leverages Gemini for intelligent text extraction and narrative structuring, and Google Cloud TTS for high-quality audio synthesis, with a focus on natural pronunciation and scalable cloud architecture.

# Product Guide
## Target Audience
- **News Consumers**: Individuals who prefer listening to news content while on the move or multi-tasking.
- **Content Platforms**: Media organizations looking to enrich their digital offerings with automated, high-quality audio versions of their articles.

## Value Proposition
- **Automated High-Quality Production**: Drastically reduces the manual effort and cost traditionally associated with professional audio content creation.
- **Engaging Narrative Structure**: Goes beyond simple text-to-speech by using LLMs to structure articles into dynamic multi-speaker dialogues (e.g., Narrator vs. Reporter).

## Key Success Factors
- **Natural Pronunciation (IPA)**: Utilizing advanced phonetic dictionary management and Gemini-powered search to ensure perfect pronunciation of names, brands, and technical terms.
- **Scalability & Cloud Integration**: A robust architecture that leverages Google Cloud services (TTS, Vertex AI, Storage, Firebase) for handling production volumes and caching.

## Roadmap & Vision
- **Multi-language Support**: Expanding the system's capabilities to support global news articles beyond the initial French focus.
- **Advanced Voice Customization**: Introducing features for voice cloning or fine-tuning to provide a more tailored and branded audio experience.
